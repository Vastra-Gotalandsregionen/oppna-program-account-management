#summary A portlet for changing one's own password without entering the current password.

= Introduction =

The portlet shows a form where the user enters his/her new password. After confirmation a request is made to change the password. If the user is a Domino user his/her Domino password will also change as well as the LDAP password which is used to authenticate in Liferay.

The portlet should only be accessible when the user is authenticated with e-identification (e-legitimation). That makes it secure to let the user change password without entering the current password.
