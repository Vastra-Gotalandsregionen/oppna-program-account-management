#summary A portlet for changing one's own password without entering the current password.
#labels password,ldap,domino

= Introduction =

The portlet shows a form where the user enters his/her new password. After form submission a request is made to change the password.

The password is changed for both domino and non-domino users. For non-domino users the password is only changed in the LDAP catalog. For domino users the password is updated both in Domino and in the LDAP catalog.

The portlet should only be accessible when the user is authenticated with e-identification (e-legitimation). That makes it secure to let the user change password without entering the current password.

Below is an activity diagram illustrating the flow:
