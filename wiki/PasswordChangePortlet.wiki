#summary A portlet for changing one's own password without entering the current password.

= Introduction =

The portlet shows a form where the user enters his/her new password. After form submission a request is made to change the password.

Note that password change is currently only available for non-domino users. If a user is a domino user he/she will be informed about proper actions to change his/her password.

The portlet should only be accessible when the user is authenticated with e-identification (e-legitimation). That makes it secure to let the user change password without entering the current password.
